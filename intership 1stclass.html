        <p class="intropara">
          Metallica is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981
          in Los Angeles by vocalist and guitarist James Hetfield and drummer
          Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its
          career.[1][2] The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive
          musicianship made them one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash
          metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current
          lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and
          Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, and bassist Robert
          Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine, who formed Megadeth after being
          fired from Metallica, and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and
          Jason Newsted are former members of the band.

          Metallica first found commercial success with the release of its third
          album, Master of Puppets (1986), which is cited as one of the heaviest
          metal albums and the band's best work. The band's next album, ...And
          Justice for All (1988), gave Metallica its first Grammy Award
          nomination. Its fifth album, Metallica (1991), was the band's first
          not to root predominantly in thrash metal; it appealed to a more
          mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and
          selling more than 16 million copies in the United States to date,
          making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. After
          experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent
          releases, Metallica returned to its thrash metal roots with the
          release of its ninth album, Death Magnetic (2008), which drew similar
          praise to that of the band's earlier albums. The band's eleventh and
          most recent album, 72 Seasons, was released in 2023. In 2000,
          Metallica led the case against the peer-to-peer file sharing service
          Napster, in which the band and several other artists filed lawsuits
          against the service for sharing their copyright-protected material
          without consent, eventually reaching a settlement. Metallica was the
          subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film Metallica: Some Kind of
          Monster, which documented the troubled production of the band's eighth
          album, St. Anger (2003), and the internal struggles within the band at
          the time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall
          of Fame. The band co-wrote the screenplay for and starred alongside
          Dane DeHaan in the 2013 concert film Metallica: Through the Never, in
          which the band performed live against a fictional thriller storyline.
